# Project Overview

**_This project presents an advanced image classification system aimed at recognizing and categorizing mushrooms found across the globe. Leveraging the power of deep learning and transfer learning, the model classifies mushrooms into three major genera:_**

- **_Boletus_**
- **_Lactarius_**
- **_Russula_**

**_By analyzing visual features through neural networks, the project seeks to support accurate and efficient species identification — a valuable tool for researchers, hobbyists, and mycologists._**

## **Technologies Used**

- Python 3.10.16
- TensorFlow/Keras
- Flask
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- OpenCV
- NumPy/Pandas

## **Model Architecture**

The classification model is built using transfer learning with pre-trained neural networks. The trained model is saved as `Mushroom Classification Model.h5` in the root directory.

## **Dataset**

The dataset is organized in the Dataset folder with separate test and train directories. It consists of images of three main mushroom genera:

- Boletus
- Lactarius
- Russula

### 🌱 **Future Improvements**

🔍 _Expand dataset to include more mushroom species_

📱 _Build a mobile version using Flutter/TensorFlow Lite_

🧾 _Add a knowledge base with mushroom descriptions_

🗺️ _Use location-based data to improve prediction context_

### ✅ **Achievements**

🎯 _Built and trained a robust image classifier with 88% accuracy_

💡 _Deployed an end-to-end Flask web application_

🧠 _Leveraged transfer learning for better performance_

☁️ _Integrated IBM Cloud-ready deployment structure_

### 📌**Conclusion**

This project showcases the potential of deep learning for biodiversity conservation and biological classification. It can assist in the safe identification of mushrooms, promote awareness of species, and serve as a valuable learning tool for enthusiasts and researchers alike.

    🌍 "Empowering nature lovers and scientists with AI tools to explore and protect fungal biodiversity."
